Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Optimize RestrictedConv2dGrowingModule to fasten the simulation of the side effect of a convolution (:gh:`99` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Split Conv2dGrowingModule into two subclass `FullConv2dGrowingModule`(that does the same as the previous class) and  `RestrictedConv2dGrowingModule` (that compute only the best 1x1 convolution as the second layer at growth time) (:gh:`92` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Code factorization of methods `compute_optimal_added_parameters` and `compute_optimal_delta` that are now abstracted in the `GrowingModule` class. (:gh:`87` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Stops automatically computing parameter update in `Conv2dGrowingModule.compute_optimal_added_parameters`to be consistent with `LinearGrowingModule.compute_optimal_added_parameters` (:gh:`87` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_) .
- Adds a generic GrowingContainer to simplify model management along with unit testing. Propagates modifications to models. (:gh:`77` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Refactor and simplify repo structure (:gh:`72` and :gh:`73` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Simplify global device handling (:gh:`72` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Integrate an MLP Mixer (:gh:`70` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Integrate a Residual MLP (:gh:`69` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Option to restrict action space (:gh:`60` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Add support for Conv2d layers in the sequential case (:gh:`34` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Replaced the `assert` statements with `self.assert*` methods in the unit tests (:gh:`50` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Reduce unit tests computational load, add parametrized unit tests (:gh:`46` by `Sylvain Chevallier`_)
- Add the possibly to separate S for natural gradient and S for new weights (:gh:`33` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Added GPU tracking (:gh:`16` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Added Bayesian Information Criterion for selecting network expansion (:gh:`16` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Unified documentation style (:gh:`14` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Updated Unit Tests (:gh:`14` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Option to disable logging (:gh:`14` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Add CI (:gh:`2` by `Sylvain Chevallier`_)
- Modify LinearGrowingModule to operate on the last dimension of an input tensor with arbitrary shape (:gh:`54` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)

Bugs
~~~~

- Delete leftover activity tensors (:gh:`78` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Fix inconsistency with torch.empty not creating empty tensors (:gh:`78` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Expansion of existing nodes not executed in GrowingDAG (:gh:`78` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Fix the computation of optimal added neurons without natural gradient step (:gh:`74` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Fix the data type management for growth related computations. (:gh:`79` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Revert global state changes, solve test issues (:gh:`70` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Fix the data augmentation bug in get_dataset (:gh:`58` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Use a different scaling factor for input and output extensions. In addition, ``apply_change`` and ``extended_forward`` have now compatible behavior in terms of scaling factor. (:gh:`48` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Fix the change application when updating the previous layer (:gh:`48` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Fix the sub-selection of added neurons in the sequential case (:gh:`41` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Correct codecov upload (:gh:`49` by `Sylvain Chevallier`_)
- Fix dataset input_shape: remove the flattening in data augmentation (:gh:`56` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Fix memory leak from issue :gh:`96` (:gh:`97` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Renamed AdditionGrowingModule to MergeGrowingModule for clarity (:gh:`84` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Added support for configuration files that override default class arguments (:gh:`38` by `Stella Douka`_)
