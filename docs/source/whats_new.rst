Develop branch

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refactor and simplify repo structure (:gh:`72` and :gh:`73` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Simplify global device handling (:gh:`72` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Option to restrict action space (:gh:`60` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Add support for Conv2d layers in the sequential case (:gh:`34` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Replaced the `assert` statements with `self.assert*` methods in the unit tests (:gh:`50` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Reduce unit tests computational load, add parametrized unit tests (:gh:`46` by `Sylvain Chevallier`_)
- Add the possibly to separate S for natural gradient and S for new weights (:gh:`33` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Added GPU tracking (:gh:`16` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Added Bayesian Information Criterion for selecting network expansion (:gh:`16` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Unified documentation style (:gh:`14` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Updated Unit Tests (:gh:`14` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Option to disable logging (:gh:`14` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Add CI (:gh:`2` by `Sylvain Chevallier`_)
- Modify LinearGrowingModule to operate on the last dimension of an input tensor with arbitrary shape (:gh:`54` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Integrate a Residual MLP (:gh:`69` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Integrate an MLP Mixer (:gh:`70` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)

Bugs
~~~~

- Revert global state changes, solve test issues (:gh:`70` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Use a different scaling factor for input and output extensions. In addition, ``apply_change`` and ``extended_forward`` have now compatible behavior in terms of scaling factor. (:gh:`48` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Fix the change application when updating the previous layer (:gh:`48` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Fix the sub-selection of added neurons in the sequential case (:gh:`41` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Correct codecov upload (:gh:`49` by `Sylvain Chevallier`_)
- Fix the data augmentation bug in get_dataset (:gh:`58` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Fix dataset input_shape: remove the flattening in data augmentation (:gh:`56` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Fix the computation of optimal added neurons without natural gradient step (:gh:`74` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for configuration files that override default class arguments (:gh:`38` by `Stella Douka`_)
